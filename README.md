# ProDev Backend Engineering Repository

This GitHub repository is more than just a collection of code it’s a personal reflection of how far I’ve come as a backend engineer. When I started the ProDev Backend Engineering program, I wasn’t a complete beginner. I already had some grounding in Python, Django, and API development, so the basics felt familiar. But what this program really gave me was the chance to push beyond that comfort zone. Docker, advanced shell scripting, CI/CD pipelines, and even background task processing were areas I had either never touched or only heard about in passing. Over twelve weeks, I got to dive into those topics, struggle with them, and finally start to feel at home working with them.

For me, this repository is both a personal knowledge hub and a way of giving back. It documents not just the *what* (the tools, frameworks, and patterns) but also the *how* (the little breakthroughs, the struggles, and the lessons I picked up along the way). My hope is that it encourages other learners who may already know the basics but want to see what it’s like to move to the next stage tackling more advanced topics without losing the sense of curiosity and experimentation.

## Objective of Repository

The core objective of this repository is to bring together the key lessons I learned during the ProDev Backend Engineering program and present them in a way that makes sense to a learner like me. It’s meant to:

* Document backend technologies, programming patterns, and system design principles at an intermediate to advanced level.
* Share the real world challenges I faced when stepping beyond the basics and the solutions that worked for me.
* Act as a guide I can come back to in the future, and maybe help someone else who already knows the basics but is looking to grow further.
* Bridge the gap with frontend learners by showing how both sides can connect to create complete applications.

## Projects Undertaken 

### Databases: From Familiar to Deeper Insights

I was already comfortable writing basic queries and setting up Django models, but ProDev pushed me to look at more advanced aspects. I worked with complex queries involving joins and window functions, and I started understanding why indexing matters when performance starts to lag. This deeper dive made me realize that databases aren’t just about storing information, they’re about structuring and retrieving it efficiently.

### Python and Django at the Next Level

I already knew how to build APIs in Django REST Framework, but ProDev helped me refine that knowledge. I practiced creating more structured ViewSets, explored permissions and authentication systems in more depth, and added Swagger documentation for clarity. On the Python side, I went beyond the basics into decorators, context managers, and asynchronous code tools that make backend applications more reliable and scalable.

### Building APIs with Confidence

REST APIs felt like second nature to me before ProDev, but the program encouraged me to try GraphQL as well. At first, it was different from the request response style I was used to, but once I understood schema-driven querying, I could see its strengths. It gave me a more rounded view of how APIs can be designed depending on the use case.

### Middleware, Signals, and Background Tasks

Middleware and signals were things I had dabbled with before, but I hadn’t fully explored their potential. Through ProDev, I built custom middleware for tasks like IP tracking and logging, and I began to appreciate how signals help in keeping code loosely coupled. The big leap for me here was Celery with RabbitMQ learning how to handle background tasks and scheduling jobs gave me a new sense of what production level systems require.

### Docker and Deployment: A Whole New World

Docker was one of the areas where I truly felt like a beginner again. At first, I didn’t get why containers mattered. But once I saw how Docker could package my Django app together with mySQL and Redis into isolated environments, it clicked. It wasn’t always smooth, I spent time debugging Dockerfiles and Compose configurations but those struggles made me comfortable with containerization. Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins also added another dimension: learning how professional teams ship code consistently.

### Performance and Caching

Before ProDev, caching was more of a buzzword to me. During the program, I experimented with Redis and saw how it could drastically reduce response times. I also learned how to think about query performance more deliberately. These lessons reminded me that sometimes the biggest improvements don’t come from adding features, but from making what you already have run faster and smoother.

### Security and IP Tracking

I had some awareness of security concepts, but working on middleware for IP tracking and rate limiting made me think more practically about them. It was one thing to read about securing apps, but another to actually implement controls that stop abuse or ensure compliance. It gave me a new respect for the role of security in backend engineering.

### Shell Scripting and Automation: Leveling Up

Shell scripting was another big jump for me. I knew a few basic commands, but I had never used shell scripts to automate real tasks. ProDev changed that. I learned how to combine tools like `curl`, `jq`, `awk`, and `sed` to test APIs, transform data, and even run parallel jobs. At first, the syntax felt awkward, but over time I began to see the elegance and power in chaining commands to create workflows that save time and effort.

## Challenges & Solutions

Some challenges were brand new to me, while others came from trying to push past the basics:

* Learning Docker from scratch, and spending hours debugging why containers wouldn’t talk to each other until I understood networking.
* Writing shell scripts that failed over and over before I figured out quoting and piping properly.
* Handling async code in Python and realizing it required a different way of thinking compared to traditional synchronous flows.
* Setting up CI/CD pipelines and being surprised at how small misconfigurations could break the whole chain.

Each of these moments felt frustrating at the time, but they ended up being my biggest wins. They reminded me that backend engineering is about persistence as much as knowledge.

## Best Practices & Takeaways

Looking back, here are some of the lessons that stick with me:

* The basics are important, but stepping into intermediate and advanced concepts is where you really grow.
* Docker and CI/CD might seem intimidating at first, but once you understand them, they make your life much easier.
* Shell scripting can feel old school, but it’s incredibly powerful for automation and backend workflows.
* Good practices like caching, logging, and testing are what separate working code from production ready systems.
* Backend engineering isn’t about mastering everything at once it’s about building on what you know, layer by layer.

This repository reflects where I started, what I already knew, and the new skills I picked up along the way. It shows that growth in backend engineering is a mix of refining the familiar and venturing into the unfamiliar and that combination is what makes the journey worthwhile.
